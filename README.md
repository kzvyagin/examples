Welcome "%username" ! Here is some c++ and qt examples.

## Repository structure
* shared_pointer_array - Demonstrate shared pointer dynamic array usage.
* vector_memory_allocation - Demonstate how memory  allocation works in std::vector lib  
* containers_speed_test - Simple example to demonstrate complexity  of different containers. Starts with two cases. First instant growth one by one. Second, step by step grows and shrinks container several times.
* qt_lambda_slot - Demonstrate worst practice, lambda in class constructor with a global context.
* qt_threads_demo - Demonstrate best practice with qt threads.
