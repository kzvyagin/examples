# Here is a couple of c++ examples 

* shared_pointer_array - Demonstrate shared pointer dynamic array usage.
* vector_memory_allocation - Demonstate how memory  allocation works in std::vector lib  
* containers_speed_test - Simple example to demonstrate complexity  of different containers. Starts with two cases. First instant growth one by one. Second, step by step grows and shrinks container several times.
